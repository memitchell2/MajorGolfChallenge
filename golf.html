        <p style="color:rgb(222, 144, 35);">This is my official golf ball ranking. These are my criteria:<br>
        1. Price, as a high handicapper you have to love budget golf balls<br>
        2. Performance, the best ball is a ball that goes far<br>
        3. Style, look good play good <br></p>
    
        <p style="color: coral;">Number 1: <br>
        Kirkland Signature, it is hard to find any other golf ball that is cheaper let alone performs better. 
        A excellent golf ball that may be the only reason that I will get a "Costco Membership", and oh did I mention that their old school design is excellent?
        Well it is, and this is the best golf ball on the market.</p>
